# Caret

Caret is a context-aware productivity app designed for knowledge workers.
It **captures** your current desktop screen, **predicts** your next actions, and **assistant** you auto-complete tasks with a simple hotkey (double-tap option`⌥` key).

*Caret is built for those who think faster than they can type.For the creators, the planners, the doers—whose days are filled with ideas, but bogged down by repetitive clicks, copy-paste loops, and context switching.We believe your focus should stay on what matters. Let Caret handle the routine—predict your next move, complete your thoughts, and automate the tasks that slow you down.*
